Public Dataset of Accelerometer Data for Human Motion Primitives Detection
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. What is it?
--------------

The Public Dataset of Accelerometer Data for Human Motion Primitives Detection is a public collection of labelled accelerometer data recordings to be used for the creation and validation of acceleration models of human motion primitives.

We believe that, in a similar fashion to computer vision public datasets, the adoption of common testbenches for human motion primitives detection algorithms will allow for a better comparison between different approaches and ultimately lead to the development of more accurate and reliable solutions.

Detailed documentation about the dataset is provided in the file MANUAL.TXT.
