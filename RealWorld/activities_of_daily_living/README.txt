==================================================================

This dataset comprises information regarding the ADLs performed by two users on a daily basis in their 
own homes. This dataset is composed by two instances of data, each one corresponding to a different 
user and summing up to 35 days of fully labelled data. Each instance of the dataset is described by 
three text files, namely: description, sensors events (features), activities of the daily living (labels). 
Sensor events were recorded using a wireless sensor network and data were labelled manually.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'OrdonezA_Description.txt' - Setting configuration for user 'A'.

- 'OrdonezA_Sensors.txt' - Sensor events for user 'A'.

- 'OrdonezA_ADLs.txt' - Activity labels for user 'A'.

- 'OrdonezB_Description.txt' - Setting configuration for user 'B'.

- 'OrdonezB_Sensors.txt' - Sensor events for user 'B'.

- 'OrdonezB_ADLs.txt' Activity labels for user 'B'.

Notes: 
======
- Each sensor event and each activity label is a row on the corresponding text file.

- The format of this dataset is based on the data published by Tim van Kasteren et. al. To obtain further details about such dataset, visit https://sites.google.com/site/tim0306/.
  Both datasets share format and type of sensors, but not the collection of ADLs. However, the characteristics of these datasets are similar enough to be easily included in the same 
  experimentation setup.
